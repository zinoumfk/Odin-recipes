        <h1>Lasagna</h1>

        <img src="lasgna.jpg" alt="the finished dish">

         <h2>Description: </h2>

                  <p>Lasagne originated in Italy during the Middle Ages.
          The oldest transcribed text about lasagne appears in 1282 in the memrialisian 
         in which lasagne was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary
         while the first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th-century Liber de Coquina </p>
               <br>
                  <p> bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagne, 
          featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets boiled 
         sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick.
         Recipes written in the century following the Liber de Coquina recommended boiling 
         the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe 
         adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended.</p>
